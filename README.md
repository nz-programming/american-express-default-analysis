## Analyzing data on "American Express - Default Prediction" on Kaggle
This notebook is for "American Express - Default Prediction" on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/
The dataset used in the notebook comes from MUNUM: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/munumbutt/amexfeather
This model scored 0.79748 which is ranked 2662 out of 4876.

## Purpose of this work
- To learn how to analyze data that is as large as cause a memory leak
- To understand how to implement binary classification with lightgbm
- To learn an effective way to visualize and understand data

## Main Technologies
 - Python
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-learn
    - LightGBM

## Points of Analyzing
- Minimizing the amount of data on memory so that memory leaks won't occur
- Adjusting parameters of the model by using optuna to optimize the model
- Making figures graphically to be able to be intuitive

## Future learning
- Making effective feature engineering
- Implementing the better preprocessing
- Building ensemble learning
