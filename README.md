## Analyzing data on "American Express - Default Prediction" on Kaggle
This notebook is for "American Express - Default Prediction" on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/
The dataset used in notebook comes from MUNUM: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/munumbutt/amexfeather
This model score 0.79748 which is ranked 2662 out of 4876.

## Puporse of this work
- To learn how to analyze a data that is as large as cause memory leak
- To understand how to impliment binary classification with lightgbm
- To learn effective way to visualize and understand data

## Main Technologies
 - Python
    - NumPy
    - Pandas
    - Matplotlib
    - Scikit-learn
    - LightGBM

## Points of Analyzing
- Minimizing the amount of data on memory so that memory leak won't be occured
- Adjusting parameter of model by using optuna to optimize the model
- Making figure graphically to be able to be intuitive

## Future learning
- Making effective feature engineering
- Implementing the more better preprocessing
- Buildiing ensemble learning
